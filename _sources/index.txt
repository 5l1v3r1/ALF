.. topic:: Abstract

   This module provides an API for software developers, testers, and security
   researchers to implement a plugin for fuzzing with ALF. This API is intended to
   provide a rich set of capabilities for template mutation and fault detection,
   allowing the user to interface their project to the ALF distributed fuzzing
   cloud quickly and easily.
